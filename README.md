# Bootstrap Baqend Starter Kit
With this starter project you can easily build application based on:

- [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) for a responsive, easy-to-use frontend
- [Baqend](http://www.baqend.com/) for hosting the application, storing data, managing users and executing server-side logic
- [Less](http://lesscss.org/) for powerfull CSS styling
- [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) for building, deploying and live-reloading

## How to use it

    $ git clone git@github.com:Baqend/bootstrap-starter.git
    $ cd bootstrap-starter
    $ npm install
    
After, run

    $ gulp
    
...for a local server with live-reloading anytime you change a file: [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888)

If gulp cannot be found, you need to install it globally with `npm install -g gulp`. If you do not have npm installed, [get it here](https://nodejs.org/en/).
